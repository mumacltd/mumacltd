## Mumac Ltd 


Mumac Ltd is a spin out from the University of Manchester, UK. 

We develop medical devices to help us carry out research into the effects of macular disease.

Our first product is the [Rapida Dark Adaptometer](https://www.mumacltd.com/about-rapida/), Rapida is a new instrument designed to measure how quickly the eye improves sensitivity in dim lighting. When the lighting is low the rod photoreceptors, specialised for seeing in the dark, begin regenerating fresh photopigment. How quickly they can do this is a measure of retinal healthiness. The result is slowed sensitivity recovery.
